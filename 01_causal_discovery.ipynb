    "In order to isolate the influence we plan to estimate,  we need first to understand the relations among the available features.  We will use [PC algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2A61bJ0UCw) implemented in the [PyWhy](https://www.pywhy.org/) package called [causal-learn](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn), to discover the basic skeleton of the network. Before generating the skeleton, it is possible to set some requirements on the graph. For example, we discussed in the previous notebook that ```Size``` affects ```IT Spend``` and ```Employee Count``` influences ```PC Count```. We will add these causal connections when we generate the graph."
